 Play the Chrome Dinosaur Game using your physical body movements!

🔖The Chrome Dinosaur Game is a hidden game in the Chrome browser that you can play when the internet goes down. The objective of this game is to simply avoid obstacles by either jumping or ducking.

💡It does this with a force sensing resistor and stretch sensor (a conductive rubber cord) to detect jumping and ducking and uses an Arduino MKR board since it supports the Keyboard library (other boards that can be used as a keyboard are the Leonardo, Esplora, Zero, Due and the MKR Family).

📑 INSTRUCTIONS

1.) Build the circuit using the schematic in the "Schematics" of the repo.

2.) Upload the code which can be found in the main.code of this repo.

3.) Adjust the threshold values in lines 3 and 4.

5.) Plug in the device, turn off the internet connection on your computer, and open Chrome to play the game! Remember to turn the internet connection back on afterwards.
